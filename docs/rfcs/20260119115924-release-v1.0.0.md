# Release v1.0.0

This RFC documents the release of version v1.0.0 of the Anki TTS CLI project. This version marks the first stable release following the renaming from "GoldenDict TTS".

## Implementation Details

### Analytics
The decision to release v1.0.0 is driven by the stabilization of the codebase and the successful generalization of the tool from being GoldenDict-specific to a general-purpose CLI for TTS and audio dictionary playback. The project has undergone a significant rename to reflect this broader scope.

### Decisions
1.  **Renaming**: The project folder and main script have been renamed to `20260119103526-anki-tts-cli` and `anki-tts-cli.py` respectively.
2.  **Documentation Update**: README and other documentation are updated to reflect the new names and usage.
3.  **Versioning**: Adopting Semantic Versioning, starting with v1.0.0.

### Release Checklist
